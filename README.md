## Contributing

You will need NodeJS to contribute. To do so, install it from <https://nodejs.org/en/download/current>.

To modify the code, you must install TailwindCSS. To do so, run:

```console
npm install -D tailwindcss
```

Then, run a watcher to recompile the CSS generated by TailwindCSS:

```console
npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./public/tailwind.css --watch
```
